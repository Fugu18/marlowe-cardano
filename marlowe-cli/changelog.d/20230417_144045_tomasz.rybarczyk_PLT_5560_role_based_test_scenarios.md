### Removed

- Removed `RuntimeAwaitInputsApplied`, `RuntimeAwaitContractCreated` - the can be easily simulated by using the new `awaitConfirmed` param.

### Added

- Added `awaitConfirmed` - most of the actions provide this optional await setup now.

- Added `RuntimeWithdraw` action to the marlowe-cli testing DSL.

- Added `RuntimeAwaitTxsConfirmed` action which awaits all the pending Marlowe transaction till they are registered in the Runtime.

### Changed

- Changed encoding of operations so we don't use `tag` field but instead a constructor name is a key in a singleton object.

- Improve report structure to incorporate more details.
