### Removed

* `RuntimeAwaitInputsApplied`, `RuntimeAwaitContractCreated` - the can be easily simulated by using the new `awaitConfirmed` param.

### Added

* `awaitConfirmed` - most of the actions provide this optional await setup now.

* `RuntimeWithdraw` action to the marlowe-cli testing DSL

* `RuntimeAwaitTxsConfirmed` action which awaits all the pending Marlowe transaction till they are registered in the Runtime.
