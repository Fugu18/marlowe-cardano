- Comment: The lender should have about 76 ADA now, since 2 ADA was sent to the script address when creating the contract, 2 ADA was sent the borrower along with the role token, and up to 1 ADA in fees might have been paid.

- CheckBalance:
    wallet: Lender
    balance:
      - [ADA, 76]
      - [RoleTokenCurrency, LenderRoleToken, 1]

- Comment: The borrower should now have their original 10 ADA plus the 2 ADA that arrived with the role token.

- CheckBalance:
    wallet: Borrower
    balance:
      - [ADA, 12]
      - [RoleTokenCurrency, BorrowerRoleToken, 1]

- Comment: Since the timeout has expired, the lender closes the contract, receiving their 2 ADA back.
